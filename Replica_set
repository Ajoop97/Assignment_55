Q.) Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

A common use-case where we might use a DaemonSet instead of a ReplicaSet is for deploying system-level agents or utilities across every node in a Kubernetes cluster.
Let's say we have a logging agent, monitoring agent, or a networking proxy that needs to run on every node in our Kubernetes cluster, regardless of its size or scaling.
In this Scenario, we'd want to ensure that each node has exactly one instance of these agents running, ensuring that they're always available and properly configured across the entire cluster.

This is where a DaemonSet shines. By defining a DaemonSet in Kubernetes, we instruct the cluster to run a specific pod on each node, ensuring that the desired number of pods is always running on every node.
